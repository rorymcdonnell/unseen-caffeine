      "At present all of his 6 hectares are organic shaded coffee and is in the process of obtaining the relevant certifications. Don Jose bought the farm 6 years ago and has invested time and effort to re-purpose a patch for a combination of coffee, honey, plantain and even cassava. He is a true believer of preserving Colombia's biodiversity so most of the farm remains a virgin forest where his cattle mingles.",

      "Years ago Hernan Arias gambled everything he had and started a new venture. He moved with all his family to the beautiful region of Herrera in Tolima. There he invested everything he owned in 18 hectares of steep land and started growing coffee. It was a fast but difficult curve but he has managed to produce an absolutely delightful microlot with amazing notes and consistency. Today all his family is involved in the production of great coffee and they are extremely proud of their achievements. Hernan is a keen grower always trying to improve and implement new growing techniques.",

      "The Misak or Guambianos are an indigenous community based in the Cauca region of Colombia. Their culture is strongly connected with mother nature and coffee production has to be compatible with the laws of nature. That is their main focus and priority. The land is owned by the community and hand picked by the entire group (no need to hire labour) as social commitment to help one another. In their search for harmony with mother nature, this coffee is processed at the local washing station and sun dried, giving it its peculiar physical aspect, reason why we decided to take it through the decaf process as commitment with the misak community of buying their coffee was the priority.",
